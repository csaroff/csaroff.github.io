  Hi, I'm Chaskin Saroff. I'm a full stack machine learning engineer who loves building data-science and developer tools.
  I've previously worked at IBM, Bad-Monkeys and B-Stock and now I'm building ML models to automate obstetrics reporting at [BioticsAI](biotics.ai).
  I love building tools that save people time and make their lives easier. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning and health science.
  Automation is changing the way that science is done and I'm excited to be a part of that.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
