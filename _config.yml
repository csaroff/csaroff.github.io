  Hi, I'm Chaskin Saroff. I'm a full stack machine learning engineer who loves building data-science and developer tools.
  I've previously worked at IBM, Bad-Monkeys and B-Stock and now I'm building ML models to automate obstetrics reporting at [BioticsAI](biotics.ai).
  I love building tools that save people time and make their lives easier. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning and health science.
  Automation is changing the way that science is done and I'm excited to be a part of that.

          I started my career off at IBM cloud. My team built and maintained the account management, billing and analytics systems.

          We wrote almost everything using node, express, and couchdb with react frontends when a frontend was required.
          I was there for three years and so I had my hands in many pies, including:
            - Email notifications for outages and customer-lifecycle events.
            - Data pipelines for funneling behavioural and billing data into our analytics systems.
            - An event-based messaging system for any events that happened on the cloud platform.

          One issue we had at the time was that nearly all of our microservice infrastructure was built on top of cloudant, IBM's couchdb-as-a-service offering.
          Whenever cloudant had an outage(which was fairly often at the time), many of our microservices would go down.
          The outage was usually localized to a specific cloudant cluster, but all of our microservices were hosted on the same cluster.
          To mitigate these downtime issues, I setup a secondary backup cluster with bi-directional replication where we could failover to in the event of an outage.
          I added a proxy in front of the clusters that would route traffic to the healthy cluster and failover to the backup cluster if the primary cluster was down.
          This was a huge improvement for our uptime and allowed us to keep our SLAs.

          After a few years at IBM, I decided to move on to pursue my interests in machine learning and data science.

          I started programming on my TI-84 in middle school, writing text-based games and algebra solvers. My high-school didn't offer programming classes, so when I finally graduated I was starving to learn more.
          I was also fascinated with mathematics, spending many evenings in the math lab helping other students with their homework.
          College was an amazing experience for me. It was the first time that I felt truly independent. I finally had the freedom to pursue programming and I was surrounded by people with the same interests and passions as me!
          To help pay for college, I worked as a residence assistant and math and computer science tutor. I joined the math and computer science clubs, winning the first place prize of a raspberry py in our CS2 programming competition.
          It's difficult to convey how special my time at Oswego was. I met some of my best friends there and I learned a lot about myself. Being in an environment where everyone is passionate about learning really brought out the best side of me.
